# Implementation Summary: Auth + Delete + Thumbnail

**Branch:** `feat/auth-delete-thumb`  
**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## 📋 Overview

This PR implements three major features:
1. **Supabase JWT Authentication** with route protection
2. **Cascading Delete** functionality (S3 + DB + Meilisearch)
3. **Automatic Thumbnail Generation** using Sharp

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Frontend (Nuxt 3)
- ✅ Added `@nuxtjs/supabase` module
- ✅ Created login page (`/login`) with email/password auth
- ✅ Created logout page (`/logout`) with auto-redirect
- ✅ Implemented global auth middleware for route protection
- ✅ Added auth plugin that injects JWT into API requests
- ✅ Auto-refresh token on 401 errors with retry logic
- ✅ Updated header with user email and login/logout CTAs
- ✅ Protected `/upload` route with `requiresAuth` meta

#### API (NestJS)
- ✅ Installed `jose` for JWT verification
- ✅ Created `SupabaseAuthGuard` with JWKS verification
- ✅ Created `@CurrentUser()` decorator for extracting user info
- ✅ Protected endpoints:
  - `POST /uploads/signed-url`
  - `GET /uploads/signed-get`
  - `POST /assets` (finalize)
  - `PATCH /assets/:id`
  - `DELETE /assets/:id`
- ✅ Added ownership checks on update/delete operations

#### Database
- ✅ Added `ownerId` field to Asset model
- ✅ Created migration `20251026114459_add_owner_and_thumbnail`
- ✅ Added index on `ownerId` for performance

### 2. Delete Functionality

#### API
- ✅ Implemented `AssetsService.delete(id, userId)`
  - Loads asset and validates ownership
  - Deletes from S3 (both original and thumbnail)
  - Deletes from PostgreSQL
  - Removes from Meilisearch index
  - Idempotent: handles missing S3 objects gracefully
- ✅ Added `DELETE /assets/:id` endpoint
- ✅ Returns `{ ok: true }` on success

#### Frontend
- ✅ Added delete button in asset detail page
- ✅ Implemented confirmation modal with warning
- ✅ Shows loading state during deletion
- ✅ Redirects to `/assets` on success
- ✅ Added `deleteAsset()` to useAssets composable

### 3. Thumbnail Generation

#### Worker
- ✅ Installed `sharp` for image processing
- ✅ Created thumbnail worker with BullMQ
- ✅ Processor logic:
  - Skips non-images
  - Skips if thumbnail already exists
  - Downloads original from S3
  - Resizes to 512x512 (cover fit) as webp @ 82% quality
  - Uploads to `thumbs/<basename>-<assetId>.webp`
  - Updates DB with `thumbKey`, `thumbWidth`, `thumbHeight`
  - Updates Meilisearch index
- ✅ Queue: `thumbnails`, Job: `generate-thumbnail`
- ✅ Concurrency: 2
- ✅ Installed `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@prisma/client`

#### API
- ✅ Created `ThumbnailProducer` service
- ✅ Enqueues job on asset finalize
- ✅ Added thumbnail fields to Asset model

#### Frontend
- ✅ Updated Asset type with `thumbKey`, `thumbWidth`, `thumbHeight`
- ✅ Modified `useAssets` to prefer `thumbKey` over `key` in listings
- ✅ Created `useAutoRefreshUrl` composable for handling 403 errors
- ✅ Asset list shows thumbnails automatically

### 4. Signed URL Improvements
- ✅ Updated default TTL to 15 minutes (900s)
- ✅ Auto-refresh helper handles 403 errors
- ✅ Max 2 retries per URL

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Auth Flow**
  - [ ] Login with valid credentials
  - [ ] Login with invalid credentials (should fail)
  - [ ] Logout and redirect to home
  - [ ] Access `/upload` without auth → redirect to `/login`
  - [ ] Token refresh on 401 (expire token manually)

- [ ] **Upload & Thumbnail**
  - [ ] Upload image → thumbnail generated within 5-10s
  - [ ] Upload non-image → no thumbnail
  - [ ] Asset list shows thumbnail for images
  - [ ] Asset detail shows full-size image

- [ ] **Delete**
  - [ ] Delete own asset → S3 + DB + Search removed
  - [ ] Try to delete another user's asset → 403 Forbidden
  - [ ] Confirm redirect to `/assets` after delete

- [ ] **Signed URLs**
  - [ ] URL expires after 15 minutes
  - [ ] Image auto-refreshes on 403 (test by manually expiring)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Setup Supabase Project**
   ```bash
   # Create project at supabase.com
   # Get anon key and project ref
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   echo "SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co" >> apps/frontend/.env
   echo "SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key" >> apps/frontend/.env

   # API
   echo "SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=xxx" >> apps/api/.env
   echo "SUPABASE_JWKS_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json" >> apps/api/.env
   ```

3. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pnpm prisma migrate deploy
   ```

4. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - API
   cd apps/api && pnpm start:dev

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd apps/frontend && pnpm dev

   # Terminal 3 - Worker
   cd apps/worker && pnpm start:dev

   # Terminal 4 - Infrastructure (if not running)
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Create Test User**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Create test user manually OR use Supabase signup API

## 📝 Notes

### Security
- JWT verification uses JWKS (no shared secret)
- Ownership enforced at service layer
- Protected routes use `SupabaseAuthGuard`

### Performance
- Thumbnails generated asynchronously
- Concurrent processing: 2 workers
- S3 batch delete for multiple objects
- Idempotent operations for reliability

### Error Handling
- 401 → auto token refresh → retry
- 403 on signed URL → auto refresh (max 2 retries)
- S3 object not found → continue (idempotent)
- Meilisearch errors → logged but not fatal

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Work

1. **No bulk delete** - Only single asset delete
2. **No progress indicator** for thumbnail generation
3. **No user registration UI** - Must create via Supabase dashboard
4. **Toast notifications** - Using `alert()` for now
5. **No image validation** - Worker will fail on corrupt images

## 📚 ADRs Created

- None (consider documenting auth strategy)
